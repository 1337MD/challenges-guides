What's up, Doc?

**Description:** Ever heard about executable documents? Well know youâ€™ve heard for sure. 
Would you get the flag for us please?

Extract the flag from given file. Flag looks like: `1337.MD{`*something_random_or_not*`}`

There are multiple ways to solve this challenge. One of them is opening the PDF file on a Windows VM.
From the beginning it shows an `alert` box with the following message: `Welcome to 1337.MD challenge`.
A first sign there is some code embedded in the document.

After few seconds it tries to connect to localhost `127.0.0.1`. We can run Wireshark and see what request (if any)
is performed.

This is a `GET` request to `http://127.0.0.1/index.html` with following parameters:

- `type`: `flag`;
- `enc`: `yes`;
- `times`: `4`;
- `value`: `VkZaU1RtVnJOVFZPVlRWVFUwaFNlRmw2UlRWaVIxSjBWbTVzYkZkSFVuWlhiR2hMWWtabmVXTkVSbXBOTVVwdFdXcE9RMkpIU25OUFZFSm9VakZhYlZkcll6VmhiVnBTVUZRd1N3bz0K`;

These arguments are meaningul =)), looks like the passed value is our flag, which is 4 times encoded/encrypted. Based
on the value, it looks more like base64 encoded.

```bash
echo "VkZaU1RtVnJOVFZPVlRWVFUwaFNlRmw2UlRWaVIxSjBWbTVzYkZkSFVuWlhiR2hMWWtabmVXTkVSbXBOTVVwdFdXcE9RMkpIU25OUFZFSm9VakZhYlZkcll6VmhiVnBTVUZRd1N3bz0K" | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d
```
And we got our flag: `1337.MD{js_everywhere_just_open_the_doc}`

**Linux approach: ** If you don't have a Windows VM, then you can use `strings` command to extract the JS. As this JS
object wasn't encoded inside the document, we can easily see it.

```bash
$ strings doc.pdf

```

The script is a little obfuscated. Looks like HEX code. If we decode it to ASCII directly, we get:

- `Welcome to 1337.MD challenge`;
- `alert`;
- `http://127.0.0.1/index.html?type=flag&enc=yes&times=4&value=VkZaU1RtVnJOVFZPVlRWVFUwaFNlRmw2UlRWaVIxSjBWbTVzYkZkSFVuWlhiR2hMWWtabmVXTkVSbXBOTVVwdFdXcE9RMkpIU25OUFZFSm9VakZhYlZkcll6VmhiVnBTVUZRd1N3bz0K`;
- `HTML`;
- `submitForm`;

We have the request URL -> we have the flag.
